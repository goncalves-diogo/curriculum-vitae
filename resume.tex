		\begin{cvsubsection}{Projects}{}{}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Ray tracer} (2020). Implemented Ray tracing algorithms in C++ and CUDA, optimized the implement by adding features such as russian roulette, Parallel BBVH, multi-threading.
				\item \textbf{Interactive Wind} (2020). Developed a real time realistic wind simulation in GLSL. Focus of the project was to research known implementations of wind interaction with multiple objects and combine them into a realistic solution to integrate with an engine using shaders.
				\item \textbf{Procedural Terrain Generation} (2019-2020). Developed a real time procedural physically accurate terrain generator. The focus of the project was to research and implement graphical algorithms published on research papers. Then combine them into a procedural terrain generator using shaders.
