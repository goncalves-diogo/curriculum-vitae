		\begin{cvsubsection}{Projects}{}{}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Interactive Wind} (2020). Developed a real time realistic wind simulation in GLSL. Focus of the project was to research known implementations of wind interaction with multiple objects and combine them into a realistic solution to integrate with an engine using shaders.
				\item \textbf{Procedural Terrain Generation} (2020). Developed a real time procedural physically accurate terrain generator. Focus of the project was to use well know graphical algorithms like Perlin noise and combine them into a procedural terrain generator using shaders.
				\item \textbf{3D Engine} (2021 - Current).  Developed a 3D Engine that supports the creation of 3D shaders pipelines. It integrates both rasterization and ray tracing. Increased skills in C++ and MSDN.
